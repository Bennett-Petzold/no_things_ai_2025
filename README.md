# no_things_ai_2025
All Things Open 2025 Schedule Minus AI Talks.

### What?
A copy of `https://2025.allthingsopen.org/schedule` with all the "AI" talks purged.
Set to update every hour 12PM-9PM UTC from October 10th through 15th.

### Where?
https://bennett-petzold.github.io/no_things_ai_2025/

### Missed Talk?
If this list missed an AI talk,
or accidentally purges a non-AI talk,
please modify `BANNED_PHRASES` in `strip_ai/src/main.rs` and submit a PR.

### Why?
I am so tired of these "AI" talks.
I have yet to endure one that really felt worthwhile for anyone beyond surface level.
There may be good talks mixed in there, but I do not want to wade through everything else to find them.
This page is at peace.

#### Spite-based?
100% based on spite.

#### Rust?
I have a favorite programming language.
No reason to hack this together in Rust specifically.

#### Robustness?
All the durability of a paper wall.
This completely relies on raw text manipulation of a single source code line.
There not any kind of sophisticated HTML and JS parse.
